# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 14, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've been customising the html5up.net read-only template for use on my Jekyll site

**Thoughts** I've recently decided that I should begin having an online presence, starting with my own site/ this challenge (what with learning web development). It feels good to be working towards this finally! It's been a while since I messed with Jekyll, but I still think it's great.

### Day 15: July 01, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started implementing logic for the FCC Pomodoro Clock project.

---

### Day 16: July 02, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued implementing logic for the FCC Pomodoro Clock project.

**Thoughts** Figured out that moment.js seems to need milliseconds to work properly and that React prefers fat arrows when using setInterval. Tomorrow I'll work on getting the timer to change to a break timer when the session ends.

### Day 22, 23: July 10-11, Wednesday, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today I decided to start on the Hexbot [Noops Challenge](https://noopschallenge.com/).

**Thoughts**: I've never really taken much notice to colour schemes (probably because I assume I'm 'bad at design'). This is a little project that will help me choose colours when I'm building websites.

### Day 24: July 12, Friday

### Day 33, 34, 35: July 27, 28, 29, Saturday, Sunday, Monday

### Day 39: August 2, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on implementing my Adobe XD design.

https://github.com/raidzklart/signup-form

---

### Day 40, 41, 42, 43 - August 4-7: 

**Today's Progress**:  More Hacker Rank exercises.

---

### Day 44, 45: August 9-10:

**Today's Progress**: Did the Odin Project Google Homepage

**Thoughts**: Pleased to have been able to do this in just a few hours. Not very responsive yet but I'll come back to that... one day.

---

### Day 46: August 11, Sunday:

**Today's Progress**: Did Rock, Paper, Scissors for the Odin Project.

https://github.com/raidzklart/rock-paper-scissors

---

### Day 47: August 12, Monday:

**Today's Progress**: Added simple HTML UI for Rock, Paper, Scissors for the Odin Project.

---

### Day 48: August 13, Tuesday:

**Today's Progress**: Started the Etch-A-Sketch project for the Odin Project.

https://github.com/raidzklart/Etch-a-Sketch

---

### Day 49: August 14, Wednesday:

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the Etch-A-Sketch project for the Odin Project.

---

### Day 50, 51: August 16, 17, Friday, Saturday:

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the Etch-A-Sketch project for the Odin Project.

---

### Day 52: August 19, Monday:

**Today's Progress**: Finished up with the Etch-A-Sketch project for the Odin Project.

### Day 53: August 21, Wednesday:

**Today's Progress**: Started the Blogger assignment for The Odin Project.

### Day 54: August 22, Thursday:

**Today's Progress**: Continued the Blogger assignment for The Odin Project.

### Day 55: August 23, Friday:

**Today's Progress**: Continued the Blogger assignment for The Odin Project.

**Thoughts**: Finished chapters I2 and I3. Went pretty smooth but I had to google something about referential integrity at the end of chapter I3. It seems to work though...

### Day 56: August 24, Saturday:

**Today's Progress**: Continued the Blogger assignment for The Odin Project.

---

### Day 58: August 26, Monday:

**Today's Progress**: Did Building Blocks and half of Advanced Building Blocks exercises for the Odin Project

**Thoughts**: Definitely have to think more with the advanced ones but it's good to test how much I really understand some of these things that I've previously assumed I did.

**Link(s) to work**
https://github.com/raidzklart/building-blocks

---

### Day 59: August 27, Tuesday:

**Today's Progress**: Continued with Advanced Building Blocks exercises for the Odin Project

https://github.com/raidzklart/building-blocks

---

### Day 60: August 28, Wednesday:

**Today's Progress**: Finished with Advanced Building Blocks exercises for the Odin Project and started the Tic Tac Toe assignment.

**Thoughts**: Doing tic-tac-toe is helping me practise OOP. Managed to draw the board, let users choose their "weapons" (X/O) and update the board after user input.

---

### Day 61: August 29, Thursday:

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Tic Tac Toe assignment for the Odin Project.

**Thoughts**: Had some trouble implementing the logic for detecting a winner. Would probably be a good idea to do some refactoring at some point.

---

### Day 62: August 31, Saturday:

**Today's Progress**: Started the Event Manager assignment for the Odin Project.

---

### Day 63: September 8, Sunday:

**Today's Progress**: Implemented saving and loading games in the Hangman assignment for the Odin Project.

**Thoughts**: I didn't know about serializing objects before so this was really fun! I have done coded most in the last week but been terrible at tracking so I will just carry on from the day I was at.

---

### Day 64: September 9, Monday:

**Today's Progress**: Implemented fibonacci methods for the Odin Project.

---

### Day 65: September 10, Tuesday:

**Today's Progress**: Started implementing the merge sort algorithm for the Odin Project.

**Thoughts**: I decided to start from just merging 2 arrays as it was the easiest part for me to understand. Tomorrow: divide and conquer!

**Link(s) to work**
https://github.com/raidzklart/recursion

---

### Day 66: September 11, Wednesday:

**Today's Progress**: Implemented a linked list for the Odin Project, including the 2 methods for extra credit.

https://github.com/raidzklart/linked_list

---

### Day 67: September 12, Thursday:

**Today's Progress**: Created the Node class and Binary tree class for the Odin Project, including method for building the tree.

**Thoughts**: Didn't have as much time as I would have liked but having to leave it when I started getting stuck (starting to think about Breadth First Search) was probably a good thing. Sometimes I need to try harder to take breaks when I'm struggling.

**Link(s) to work**
https://github.com/raidzklart/binary-tree

---

### Day 68: September 13, Friday:

**Today's Progress**: Implemented Breadth First Search algorithm for for the Odin Project.

**Thoughts**: Coming back the following day made it much easier. Didn't take as long as I expected.

---

### Day 69: September 14, Saturday:

**Today's Progress**: Implemented Depth First Search algorithm (both with a stack and a recursive version) for for the Odin Project.

**Thoughts**: The recursive method still seems to make more sense somehow

**Link(s) to work**
https://github.com/raidzklart/binary-tree

---

### Day 70: September 15, Sunday:

**Today's Progress**: Started on the Knights Travail. Started with nodes which will eventually make up a board.

**Link(s) to work**
https://github.com/raidzklart/binary-tree

---

### Day 72: September 17, Tuesday:

**Today's Progress**: Continued Knights Travails again. Today I continued with the knight, implemented possible moves.

### Day 73: September 18, Wednesday:

**Today's Progress**: Today I started over with the Knight and board in Knights Travails.
