# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 14, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've been customising the html5up.net read-only template for use on my Jekyll site

**Thoughts** I've recently decided that I should begin having an online presence, starting with my own site/ this challenge (what with learning web development). It feels good to be working towards this finally! It's been a while since I messed with Jekyll, but I still think it's great.

### Day 2: June 15, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've finished customising the layout for the main, posts and individual post pages.

**Thoughts** Small frustration with finding assets from inside posts but nothing a google can't fix! Now just need to sort the copy.

**Today's Progress**: I did the markup for the Free Code Camp Technical Documentation Page project and added the Materialize CSS framework.
