# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 14, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've been customising the html5up.net read-only template for use on my Jekyll site

**Thoughts** I've recently decided that I should begin having an online presence, starting with my own site/ this challenge (what with learning web development). It feels good to be working towards this finally! It's been a while since I messed with Jekyll, but I still think it's great.

**Today's Progress**: I've finished customising the layout for the main, posts and individual post pages.

**Thoughts** Small frustration with finding assets from inside posts but nothing a google can't fix! Now just need to sort the copy.

### Day 16: July 02, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continued implementing logic for the FCC Pomodoro Clock project.

**Thoughts** Figured out that moment.js seems to need milliseconds to work properly and that React prefers fat arrows when using setInterval. Tomorrow I'll work on getting the timer to change to a break timer when the session ends.

**Today's Progress**: Today I decided to start on the Hexbot [Noops Challenge](https://noopschallenge.com/).

**Thoughts**: I've never really taken much notice to colour schemes (probably because I assume I'm 'bad at design'). This is a little project that will help me choose colours when I'm building websites.
